# Getting started with Connected Devices (Android)
This guide shows you how to set up the Connected Devices Platform on an Android app and use it to discover and connect to remote devices and apps. Refer to the [Android sample app](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-rome/tree/master/Android/samples) for a working example of all Android scenarios.


[!INCLUDE [android/platform-init](../../../includes/android/platform-init.md)]

At this point, your next actions will depend on which scenario(s) you intend to implement. For Device Relay scenarios, such as launching an app on a remote device or communicating with an app service on a remote device, see the [Command remote devices and apps](command-remote-devices-and-apps-android.md) guide (this also covers nearby sharing with other devices). For User Activities scenarios, such as creating, publishing, and reading Windows user activities, see the [Publish and read user activities](user-activities-android.md) guide. To make your app a host (able to be remotely launched or deliver app service resources to a remote device), see the [Host cross-device experiences](hosting-android.md) guide.
