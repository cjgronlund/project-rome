# Commanding for Android how-to guides (preview release)

Here you will find how-to guides and API reference documentation for developers who wish to implement Commanding scenarios on their Android apps. You will need an Android app development IDE and an Android device with one of the supported architectures (**armeabi-v7a**, **arm64-v8a**, **x86**, or **x86_64**) or an emulator. In any case, the system must be running Android 4.4.2 or later.

* First, see the [Getting started](how-to-guides/getting-started-rome-android.md) guide for all the preliminary steps needed to set up the Rome client SDK for Android.
* Then, see the [Commanding guide](how-to-guides/command-remote-devices-and-apps-android.md) for instructions on using Commanding features.
* See the [API reference](api-reference/index.md) page for links to the reference docs relevant to these scenarios.
* Take a look at the [Android sample app](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-rome/tree/master/Android/samples) to see a working example of Project Rome features.
