# Commanding for Android how-to guides (preview release)

Here you will find how-to guides and API reference documentation for developers who wish to implement Commanding scenarios on their Android apps. You will need an Android app development IDE and an Android device with one of the supported architectures (**armeabi-v7a**, **arm64-v8a**, **x86**, or **x86_64**) or an emulator. In any case, the system must be running Android 4.4.2 or later.

* See the [API reference](api-reference/index.md) page for links to the reference docs relevant to these scenarios.
* See the [Android sample app](https://github.com/Microsoft/project-rome/tree/master/Android/samples) to see a working example of Project Rome features.
