# Commanding

The Commanding scenarios include cases in which an app on a local device initiates some action on a remote device. These include remote app launching, remote messaging, and the process of discovering and identifying remote systems to connect to. The actions taken by these target devices are covered in the [Hosting](../hosting/index.md) scenarios.
