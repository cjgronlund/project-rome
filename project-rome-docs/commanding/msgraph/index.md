# Microsoft Graph Commanding APIs

Commanding features can be implemented through REST API calls with Microsoft Graph. This allows you to discover your devices, launch apps, and interact with app services from any device capable of making HTTP requests. Microsoft Graph makes these scenarios simpler to implement than on the native platform SDKs, but it does not support all of the features Project Rome features or offer a native object model.

You can find more information and API reference documentation in the [Project Rome section of the Microsoft Graph docs](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/resources/project_rome_overview#devices).
