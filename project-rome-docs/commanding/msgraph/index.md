# Project Rome for Microsoft Graph

Project Rome features can be implemented through REST API calls with [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/resources/project_rome_overview). This allows you to discover your windows devices, launch apps, and interact with app services from any device capable of making HTTP requests. The following REST APIs are meant for these scenarios. Follow the links for full reference documentation.

* [List the user's devices](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/api/user_list_devices)

* [Send a command to a device](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/api/send_device_command)

* [Get command status](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/api-reference/beta/api/get_device_command_status)
