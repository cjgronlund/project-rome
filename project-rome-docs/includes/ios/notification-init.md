## Preliminary setup for push notifications

### Register your app for push notifications

Register your application for [Apple Push Notification](https://developer.apple.com/notifications/) support. Be sure to make note of the sender ID and server key that you receive; you'll need them later. 

### Register your app form cross-device Connected Devices Platform access

Next, register your app for the [cross-device experiences feature of the Microsoft Developer Dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/dashboard/crossplatform/web). This is a different procedure from registering on the Windows Dev Center, which was covered in the preliminary steps above. It authorizes the Connected Devices Platform to send notifications using the native push notification service. The Dev Center on-boarding process will require:
* Your app's client ID.
* The Apple Push Notification Service key. This is needed in order to deliver data and commands to the app (on a device which may be locked or asleep) in the form of notifications. 

### Configure your app to be notification-compatible

After you complete the workflow on the Developer dashboard, you must modify the actual code of your app to make capable of receiving push notifications. First, make sure to add the "remote-notifications" **UIBackgroundMode** to your app's _Info.plist_ to allow the app to receive notifications while running in the background. 

TBD

Second, when your app starts up, you must request authorization to display alert notifications. This is done by calling either `-[UIApplication registerUsernotificationSettings:categories:]` or `-[UNUserNotificationCenter requestAuthorizationWithOptions:completionHandler:]`, depending on what version of iOS you're targeting. Once your app has acquired the authorization, you can then register to receive remote notifications by calling `-[UIApplication registerForRemoteNotifications]`. 

Some notifications from the Connected Devices Platform will present alerts, and the text of these alerts is localizable and must be inserted into your application's string resources. You must define the following resource tags in your app's _en.lproj\Localizable.strings_ file. You may need to create this file. In Xcode, select **New**, search for the file type "Strings", and create a file called _Localizable.strings_.

```ObjectiveC
/* The text of the toast notification to display when a remote command is received */ 
"ROME_REMOTE_LAUNCH" = "%1$@ wants to launch this app"; 
"ROME_REMOTE_LAUNCH_FROM_APP" = "%1$@ on %2$@ wants to launch this app"; 
 
/* The text of the toast notification to display when multiple remote commands are received simultaneously */ 
"ROME_CONNECT_TEXT_MANY" = "Another device wants to launch this app"; 
```

### Associate the notification service with the local Platform

Finally, you must associate push notification functionality with the Connected Devices Platform in your app. In the steps above, you initialized the Platform without defining the *notificationProvider* parameter. Here, you need to construct and pass in an object that implements **[MCDNotificationProvider](../../objectivec-api/core/MCDNotificationProvider.md)**. The main thing to note is the `getNotificationRegistrationAsync:` method, which must return a **[MCDNotificationRegistration](../../objectivec-api/core/MCDNotificationRegistration.md)** instance. The **MCDNotificationRegistration** is responsible for supplying the Connected Devices Platform with an access token (and related information) for the notification service.

Deliver this registration in your implementation of **MCDNotificationProvider**. Then, the Platform initialization call should provide the local Platform with access to the push notification service, allowing your app to receive data from the server-side Connected Devices Platform, which relays launch requests and app service messages from other devices. 

The following is an implementation of **MCDNotificationProvider** from the sample app.

```ObjectiveC
@implementation NotificationProvider
{
    MCDRegistrationUpdatedEvent* _registrationUpdated;
    MCDNotificationRegistration* _notificationRegistration;
}

+ (instancetype)sharedInstance
{
    static NotificationProvider* sharedInstance = nil;

    static dispatch_once_t onceToken;
    dispatch_once(&onceToken, ^{ sharedInstance = [[NotificationProvider alloc] init]; });

    return sharedInstance;
}

+ (void)updateNotificationRegistration:(MCDNotificationRegistration*)notificationRegistration
{
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0),
        ^{ [[NotificationProvider sharedInstance] _updateNotificationRegistration:notificationRegistration]; });
}

// MCDNotificationProvider
@synthesize registrationUpdated = _registrationUpdated;

- (void)getNotificationRegistrationAsync:(nonnull void (^)(MCDNotificationRegistration* _Nullable, NSError* _Nullable))completionBlock
{
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ completionBlock(_notificationRegistration, nil); });
}

- (instancetype)init
{
    if (self = [super init])
    {
        _registrationUpdated = [MCDRegistrationUpdatedEvent new];
    }

    return self;
}

- (void)_updateNotificationRegistration:(MCDNotificationRegistration*)notificationRegistration
{
    _notificationRegistration = notificationRegistration;

    [_registrationUpdated raiseWithNotificationRegistration:notificationRegistration];
}
@end
```

The following sample code updates this **MCDNotificationProvider** with a filled-in **MCDNotificationRegistration**.

```ObjectiveC
/*
* NotificationRegistration is constructed with four parameters:
* Type: This is GCM or FCM or APN (the notification platform type).
* Token: This is the NSData that APNs sends to your app delegate's didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: method. You must convert the NSData into a string by hex-encoding it.
* SenderId: This is your appâ€™s bundle identifier. 
* DisplayName: This should be the name of the app that you used when you registered it on the Microsoft dev portal. 
*/
[NotificationProvider
    updateNotificationRegistration:[[MCDNotificationRegistration alloc]
        initWithNotificationType:MCDNotificationTypeAPN
        token:deviceTokenStr
        appId:[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier]
        appDisplayName:(NSString*)[[NSBundle mainBundle]
            objectForInfoDictionaryKey:@"CFBundleDisplayName"]]];
```
