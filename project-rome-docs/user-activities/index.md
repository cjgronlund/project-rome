# User Activities

The User Activities feature allows apps to create and publish Windows-style User Activities. These are cloud-based constructs that track the state of a user's tasks in an app. Activities can then be viewed and resumed at a later time, even across different devices and platforms. For more information on User Activities, see [Continue user activity, even across devices (UWP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/useractivities).

To get started with User Activities on your device, select your preferred development platform on the left navigation pane.
